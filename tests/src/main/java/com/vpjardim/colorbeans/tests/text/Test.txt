======== Test 2 - 2018/01/11 ========
* Testing Ai3 x Ai1 *

= 2.1 (2 maps) =
A - Ai3 | wins = 60 | acc = 587.080
B - Ai1 | wins = 19 | acc = 197.060

= 2.2 (4 maps} =
A - Ai3 | wins = 1 | acc = 216.420
B - Ai1 | wins = 1 | acc = 216.480
C - Ai3 | wins = 1 | acc =  22.920
D - Ai1 | wins = 0 | acc =       0

* Screenshots in colorbeans_files\img

* Bug on 4 maps test. When 1 or 2 maps lose, trash blocks some times are missing. Probably sending
the trash blocks to the maps that already lost. Maybe this is the cause why test 2.2 had only 3
matches in 8 hours

= Test parameters =
8 hours, windowed mode, win10 dell note, vsync on, 2 games executions at the same time

= DBG parameters =
dbg.fps = true;
dbg.fpsStat = true;
dbg.logLevel = Application.LOG_INFO;
dbg.aiTraining = new int[] {3, 1, 3, 1};
dbg.on();


======== Test 1 - 2018/01/11 ========
* Testing if caching background improves the frame rate *

1.1.1 | no cache                     | fps = 170 | fps avg = 180
1.1.2 | no cache                     | fps = 160 | fps avg = 181

1.2.1 | caching only bg              | fps = 244 | fps avg = 262
1.2.2 | caching only bg              | fps = 247 | fps avg = 260
1.2.3 | caching only bg              | fps = 219 | fps avg = 237
1.2.4 | caching only bg              | fps = 241 | fps avg = 246 | 35.9% faster

1.3.1 | bg & unchanged blocks cashed | fps = ??? | fps avg = ??? | ????% faster


= Test parameters =
1 minute, 4 maps, paused, windowed mode, maximized, win10 dell note, vsync off
