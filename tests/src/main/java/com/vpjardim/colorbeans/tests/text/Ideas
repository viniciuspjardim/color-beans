 - Statistics screen (show all players score / statistics, including AI players)
 - Compare statistics between two players
 - Player can do a few moves before the play blocks are inserted (rotation not working always)
 - Improve AI skills and efficiency, and make options to it play worst (for the easy levels):
    - Doubt (the AI moves blocks, like it's in doubt where to put it);
    - Velocity (the AI don't use de down key always. Just a percentage of the play fall);
    - Quality (not always do the best move, it can do a percentage of random moves, the second
      best, the third best...);
    - Future moves limit (can calc zero or more plies ahead)
    - Move filter (limit where AI can put the blocks. So it can draw shapes with it, like level 2 or
      4 of mean bean machine)
 - Network gaming
