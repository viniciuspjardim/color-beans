# Color Beans

It's a Tetris like blocks (called beans) game. While in Tetris the goal is
to complete rows of blocks, in Color Beans the goal is to link beans of
the same color. If there is a least 4 beans of the same color linked together
they will be freed (deleted) and the player will score.

This game is a clone of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. But It does not
use any assets or code from the original game.
