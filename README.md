# Color Beans

![bean](android/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

Color Beans is a Tetris like blocks (called beans) game. While in Tetris
the goal is to complete rows of blocks, in Color Beans the goal is to
link beans of the same color. If there are at least 4 beans of the same
color linked together, they will be freed (deleted) and the player will
score.

This game is a clone of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (called Puyo
Puyo in Japan), but it does not use any assets or code from the original
game. This project is for learn and showcase purpose only.
